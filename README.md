# Coin Flipped Seed
This program provides a strong proof of the randomness used to derive your bitcoin addresses. No need for RNG and its frequent weaknesses. You can either toss a coin 128 times, roll a dice or mix a rubik's cube until you've reached the necessary 128 bits.

On coin flip:</br>
Heads = 1</br>
Tails = 0</br>
</br>
On dice roll:</br>
1 = 01</br>
2 = 10</br>
3 = 11</br>
4 = 0</br>
5 = 1</br>
6 = 00</br>
</br>
On rubik's cube mixing:</br>
blue = 00</br>
white = 01</br>
yellow = 10</br>
red = 11</br>
orange = 0</br>
green = 1</br>
